# Avengers Quiz
The Avengers Quiz is an application where users can test their knowledge 
on the Marvel Avengers movie series. The quiz is a command-line application built with Python, users of the application are to be asked ten questions and their score is kept track of throughout the duration of the quiz. Once the user finishes the quiz, the user will see their result along with a leaderboard of previous users results. Google Sheets will keep track of the leaderboard and display the results at the end of the quiz. Users will be able to retry the quiz if they so choose.
